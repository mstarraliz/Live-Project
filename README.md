# Live-Project

## My Time on Live Project

For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with a team developing a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#. This was a great learning opportunity for working in a team setting and adding requested features presented in the project. I worked on several front end stories. Because much of the site had already been built, there were also a good deal of front end stories and UX improvements that needed to be completed, all of varying degrees of difficulty. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the two week sprint I was exposed to a real time setting which will help me on future projects.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on.

## Front End Stories
* [Change Layout of Productions Edit Promo Modal](#change-layout-of-productions-edit-promo-modal)
* [Stylize the Part's Index Page](#stylize-the-part's-index-page)

### Change Layout of Productions Edit Promo Modal
On the Productions Edit page a new feature was recently added that allowed a user to select the promo (default) photo for a Production.  However, the modal that appears only shows images in a single column.  If there are many photos associated with a production, the user would have to do a lot of scrolling.  Instead of displaying all production photos in a single column, I had to allow the modal to display multiple columns.  I had to increase the number of images that can be comfortably viewed at once.  I had to make sure that the modal was responsive, making sure the number of columns displayed would gradually and dynamically adjust to the screen width.   

### Stylize the Part's Index Page
I had to add some small animations on the Part's Index page to make the page feel more interactive.  I had to implement these features:
When the admin hover's over a Part, I created an animation that increases the size of the Part.  When the admin's cursor is removed from the Part, I made sure it should scale back down to it's original size.
I styled the Edit, Delete, and Details pill buttons. They had the default styling for an anchor tag (blue text, underline on hover).  Instead of the buttons simply fading into the Part, I make a subtle animation when the admin hovers the Part.

## Other Skills Learned
* Working with a group of developers to identify front and back end bugs to the improve usability of an application
* Improving project flow by communicating through daily meetings, screen sharing or using Slack to discuss current story
* Learning new efficiencies from other developers by observing their workflow and asking questions
